Hi there!

When I translate, most of the time I'm trying to create a certain \~vibe\~ rather than aiming for complete accuracy. Although of course I try my best to make my translations as accurate as possible as well，ultimately I'm just trying to have some fun while learning Chinese. This is just a hobby for me after all! 

I started translating to improve my Chinese (and to spend less time wasting my life away on TikTok). I'm a heritage speaker but only just started seriously learning to read a couple of years ago. By "seriously" I mean I would practice daily for a few weeks and then stop for months... 

Hopefully translating will help me improve my skills more consistently!

I'm Out.
