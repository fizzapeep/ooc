Hi there!
I started translating to improve my Chinese (and to spend less time on TikTok). I'm a heritage speaker but have only just started seriously learning to read a couple of years ago. By "seriously" I mean I would practice daily for a few weeks and then stop for months... 
Hopefully translating will help me improve my skills more consistently!
I'm Out.
